        This represents the identifier of the eNB ID as specified in clause 9.2.1.37 of  3GPP TS 36.413. The string shall be formatted with the following pattern  '^('MacroeNB-[A-Fa-f0-9]{5}|LMacroeNB-[A-Fa-f0-9]{6}|SMacroeNB-[A-Fa-f0-9]{5} |HomeeNB-[A-Fa-f0-9]{7})$'. The value of the eNB ID shall be encoded in hexadecimal representation. Each character in the  string shall take a value of "0" to "9", "a" to "f" or "A" to "F" and shall represent 4 bits.  The padding 0 shall be added to make multiple nibbles, so the most significant character  representing the padding 0 if required together with the 4 most significant bits of the eNB ID  shall appear first in the string, and the character representing the 4 least significant bit  of the eNB ID (to form a nibble) shall appear last in the string.
