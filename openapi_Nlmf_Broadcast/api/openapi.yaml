            A string used to indicate the features supported by an API that is used as defined in clause  6.6 in 3GPP TS 29.500. The string shall contain a bitmask indicating supported features in  hexadecimal representation Each character in the string shall take a value of "0" to "9",  "a" to "f" or "A" to "F" and shall represent the support of 4 features as described in  table 5.2.2-3. The most significant character representing the highest-numbered features shall  appear first in the string, and the character representing features 1 to 4 shall appear last  in the string. The list of features and their numbering (starting with 1) are defined  separately for each API. If the string contains a lower number of characters than there are  defined features for an API, all features that would be represented by characters that are not  present in the string are not supported.

The most significant character representing the 4 most significant bits of the SD shall appear first in the string, and the character representing the 4 least significant bit of the SD shall appear last in the string. This is an optional parameter that complements the Slice/Service type(s) to allow to  differentiate amongst multiple Network Slices of the same Slice/Service type. This IE shall be absent if no SD value is associated with the SST.
